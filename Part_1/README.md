# Vandelay Industries - Part I


### Vandeley needs you
Business was fine until one day, **Vandelay Industries got hacked!** (maybe)
There's been a suspicion that information has been compromised from the company's databases with intention of being sold on the darkwebüï∑Ô∏è.

What we know:
* Company's owner is a silent partner named Art Vandelay, a former Architect and a current Marine Biologist (who George looks up to). 
* The network traffic is recorded 24/7 - the pcap was carved to match the date and time of the 
alleged breach.
* It's been theorised that the attacker might be someone the employees know.
* 4 days before the security breach, a letter has been placed under the 
company's door without a stamp.

### Art Vandelay, the shareholder and founder, wants to know:
* What information was leaked?
* Who is responsible?
* Who is the attacker? 
* Where is he now?
* How can we get to him?

### In order do declare this case as closed, we need you to use your investigator skills and answer these questions:

1. What IP addresses were involved and who they belong to?
2. What known ports are being used?
3. What are the passwords for George and Jerry's email?
4. What other email addresses you can find and what are their passwords?
5. Where does Kramer live?
6. In which sites were the employees browsing?
7. What is the password of the File Server?
8. What was the biggest TCP conversation?
9. Create a timeline of what happened based on what you find.

# Good Luck
