# Vandelay Industries - Part II
So after successfully solving the first part of the case and figuring out who the attacker was and what was leaked ,presenting the findings to the board proved to be futile because they declared it "circumstantial" at best.
It was decided to take things to the next level and examine Georges hard drive for any forensic evidence might be found to link back to the same attacker

Loving what you did in the previous case, the board decided to hire you once more for the task at hand!

The story remains the same, but the objective changes

We need to know:
1. What George was doing instead of working?
2. How could George fall for it? What did the attacker had to know in order to succeed?
3. What is the infection file’s name? What happened to the file after the attack?
4. Show a proof of the infection file execution.
5. What was George's user password?
6. Jerry asks George in one of the emails to read a report in the shared folder. 
   * Is this folder mapped?
   * If so, what drive letter is the folder mapped to?
   * Are there more shared folders\drives?
   * If so, who are they connected to?
7. Explore the cookie files, maybe George left you some…
8. Prove a connection between the attacks by figuring out who did it and how
